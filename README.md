# TTC-Subway-Delay-Detection-EDA
>**Created by : Nisarg Patel**
- This project demostrate our findings on delay in TTC subway in a interactive form.
- We have used diverse visualization techniques to find out :
  - Maximum,minumum delays in subway lines.
  - Busier stations in each subway lines.
  - At what time the station is busier?
  - what are the reasons for the delay? and many more useful information.
